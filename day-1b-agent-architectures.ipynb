Imagine a team of intelligent, specialized \"agents\" working tirelessly behind the scenes, tackling challenges, and optimizing your code. This isn't science fiction; it's the promise of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), and it's about to change how you build software.\n\n**Main Sections:**\n\n**1. Smarter Problem Solving: Decomposing Complexity**\n\n*   **Divide and Conquer at its Finest:** MAS allows you to break down large, intricate problems into smaller, manageable sub-problems, each handled by an agent with specialized skills.\n*   **Parallel Processing Power:** Agents can operate concurrently, significantly speeding up execution and allowing for the exploration of multiple solutions simultaneously.\n*   **Enhanced Robustness and Resilience:** If one agent fails or encounters an issue, others can often compensate, ensuring the overall system continues to function.\n\n**2. Adaptive and Dynamic Systems: Responding to Change**\n\n*   **Real-time Adaptability:** MAS can react dynamically to changing environments or unexpected inputs, adjusting their behavior and strategies on the fly.\n*   **Learning and Evolution:** Agents can learn from their experiences and interactions, improving their performance and adapting to new challenges over time.\n*   **Decentralized Decision Making:** Avoid single points of failure; individual agents can make localized decisions based on their own knowledge and the information from their peers.\n\n**3.

One storm-tossed evening, a crate, splintered and sea-worn, washed ashore. Inside, nestled amongst sodden kelp, was a scroll. Unfurling it, Elias gasped. It wasn’t parchment, but a material like hammered moonlight, etched with lines that pulsed with an ethereal, blue glow. They depicted no coastline he recognized, no sea lanes known to man.

The map hummed, a silent song of distant shores and forgotten wonders.\nCriticAgent > This is a promising start, but it needs a bit more development to truly shine.\n\nHere are a few suggestions:\n\n*   **Elaborate on Elias's character:** While we know he's a lighthouse keeper of twenty years, giving us a glimpse into his personality or motivations would make him more relatable. Is he lonely? Content? Yearning for something more? A brief internal thought or a small action could reveal a lot. For example, does he meticulously polish the lantern, or does he stare out at the sea with a wistful expression?\n*   **Build the mystery of the map:** The description of the map is evocative, but what are Elias's immediate thoughts or feelings beyond gasping? Does he feel fear, excitement, confusion? Does he try to decipher any of the symbols or relate them to anything he knows, even if he fails? Adding a moment of his internal reaction would deepen the reader's engagement.\n*   **Hint at the map's potential impact:** The story ends with the map humming, suggesting a journey or discovery. You could add a sentence that subtly hints at what Elias might do next, or the implications of this discovery for him and his isolated life. For instance, \"A spark ignited in the depths of his quiet existence, a feeling he hadn't experienced since his youth.\"\nRefinerAgent > Elias had kept the Solitude Point light for twenty years, his days measured by the sweep of the beam and the roar of the surf. He was a man carved from salt and solitude, his only companions the gulls and the ceaseless rhythm of the tide. Though content in his isolation, a quiet ache for something more sometimes settled in his chest, a feeling he’d long since learned to ignore. One storm-tossed evening, as he meticulously polished the great lantern, a crate, splintered and sea-worn, washed ashore. Inside, nestled amongst sodden kelp, was a scroll.\n\nUnfurling it, Elias gasped.

A wave of bewildered awe washed over him, a potent mix of fear and a thrill that tasted like forgotten adventure. He tried to orient himself, to match a single star-like marking to anything in his limited celestial charts, but it was no use. The map hummed, a silent song of distant shores and forgotten wonders, and Elias felt a spark ignite in the depths of his quiet existence, a feeling he hadn't experienced since his youth.\nCriticAgent > APPROVED\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"WARNING:google_genai.types:Warning: there are non-text parts in the response: ['function_call'], returning concatenated text result from text parts.

You're Now an Agent Orchestrator\n\nIn this notebook, you made the leap from a single agent to a **multi-agent system**.\n\nYou saw **why** a team of specialists is easier to build and debug than one \"do-it-all\" agent. Most importantly, you learned how to be the **director** of that team.\n\nYou used `SequentialAgent`, `ParallelAgent`, and `LoopAgent` to create deterministic workflows, and you even used an LLM as a 'manager' to make dynamic decisions. You also mastered the \"plumbing\" by using `output_key` to pass state between agents and make them collaborative.\n\n**ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n\nThis notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only.
