            "text": "Okay, a one-month, 10-hours-per-day roadmap to crack a Google interview (focusing on a general Software Engineering role, as it's the most common entry point and heavily tested in DSA) is intense but achievable with discipline. This plan prioritizes Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) as it's the cornerstone of Google's technical interviews.\n\n**Assumptions:**\n\n*   You have a foundational understanding of programming (e.g., C++, Java, or Python).\n*   You're aiming for a general Software Engineer (SWE) role, which is the most common and has the most emphasis on DSA. If targeting a specialized role like AI or DevOps, you'll need to adapt sections.\n*   You have access to resources like LeetCode, HackerRank, Educative.io, AlgoExpert, books, etc.\n\n**Philosophy:**\n\n*   **DSA First:** We'll dedicate the majority of time to DSA, as it's the highest probability area for interviews.\n*   **Consistent Practice:** Daily coding is crucial.\n*   **Learn, Practice, Review:** Understand concepts, solve problems, then review mistakes and patterns.\n*   **Mock Interviews:** Simulate the real environment towards the end.\n\n---\n\n## One Month (4 Weeks) Google Interview Prep Roadmap (10 Hours/Day)\n\n**Total Hours:** ~280 hours\n\n---\n\n### **Week 1: Foundations & Core DSA (40 Hours/Week)**\n\n**Goal:** Solidify programming language basics, understand fundamental DSA concepts, and start solving easy/medium LeetCode problems.\n\n*   **Daily Structure (Example):**\n    *   **1-2 hours: Concept Review:** Read about a DSA topic, watch a tutorial.\n    *   **6-7 hours: Problem Solving:** Solve LeetCode/HackerRank problems related to the topic.

Focus on speed and accuracy.\n        *   **Blind 75/90:** If you haven't already, consider working through curated lists like \"Blind 75\" or \"NeetCode 100/150\" as they cover high-probability topics.\n\n    *   **Days 37-38: Mock Interviews (System Design & Behavioral):**\n        *   **System Design:** Conduct 1-2 mock system design interviews per day. Practice explaining your design choices and justifying trade-offs.\n        *   **Behavioral:** Prepare your \"stories\" using the STAR method. Practice answering common behavioral questions (tell me about a time you failed, dealt with conflict, led a project). Aim for 1-2 behavioral interview simulations per day.\n\n    *   **Day 39: Final Review & Light Practice:**\n        *   Review your notes on common patterns, Big O complexities, and key system design concepts.\n        *   Solve 2-3 \"easy\" or \"medium\" problems to build confidence.\n        *   Review your personal projects – be ready to discuss them in detail.\n\n    *   **Day 40: Rest & Preparation:**\n        *   **DO NOT CRAM.** Get good sleep.\n        *   Organize your notes, resume, and any logistical details for your interview.\n        *   Mentally prepare. Remind yourself of your hard work and what you've learned.\n\n---\n\n**Important Considerations for Success:**\n\n*   **Active Learning:** Don't just passively read. Actively code, trace algorithms, and try to derive solutions yourself before looking.\n*   **Understanding vs. Memorization:** Focus on understanding the underlying principles and patterns, not just memorizing solutions. Google wants problem solvers.\n*   **Communication is Key:** Practice verbalizing your thought process. Explain what you're thinking, why you're making certain choices, and what trade-offs you're considering.\n*   **Edge Cases:** Always think about edge cases (empty inputs, single elements, maximum values, etc.).\n*   **Clean Code:** Write readable, well-structured code. Use meaningful variable names.\n*   **Review Mistakes:** Keep a log of problems you get wrong or struggle with. Revisit them periodically.\n*   **Stay Healthy:** With 10 hours a day, ensure you're getting enough sleep, eating well, and taking short breaks to avoid burnout. Short walks can be very helpful.\n*   **Adaptability:** This is a template. If you're very weak in an area, spend more time there. If you're strong, focus on harder problems or move on.\n\nThis is an aggressive schedule. Good luck! You've got this!"
