This is a truly revolutionary aspect of AI in drug discovery.\n\nLet me elaborate on what \"de novo\" means in this context and why AI is so impactful here:\n\n**What is \"De Novo\" Drug Design?**\n\n\"De novo\" is Latin for \"from the beginning\" or \"anew.\" In drug discovery, **de novo drug design** refers to the process of creating entirely new molecular structures that have never existed before, with the specific goal of interacting with a particular biological target to treat a disease.\n\nTraditionally, drug discovery often involved:\n\n*   **Screening existing libraries:** Testing thousands or millions of pre-existing chemical compounds to see if any show activity against a target.\n*   **Modifying known drugs:** Taking existing drugs and making small chemical tweaks to improve their efficacy or reduce side effects.\n\nDe novo design aims to bypass these limitations by **designing molecules from scratch**, guided by computational principles and, increasingly, by AI.\n\n**How AI is Revolutionizing De Novo Drug Design:**\n\nAI, particularly **generative AI models**, is the key driver of innovation in de novo drug design. Here's how it works:\n\n1.  **Learning Molecular Language:**\n    *   AI models are trained on massive datasets of known molecules. These datasets include their chemical structures, properties, and how they interact with biological targets.\n    *   The AI learns the \"rules\" of chemistry – what makes a molecule stable, how atoms bond, what functional groups are important for binding to proteins, etc. It learns a kind of \"molecular language.\"\n\n2.  **Generating Novel Structures:**\n    *   Once trained, these generative models can be prompted to create new molecules. The prompt typically includes desired properties, such as:\n        *   **Target binding affinity:** How well the molecule should bind to a specific protein or receptor associated with a disease.\n        *   **Pharmacokinetic properties (ADMET):** Desired characteristics like absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity – essentially, how the drug behaves in the body.\n        *   **Chemical diversity:** Encouraging the generation of unique structures that are distinct from existing drugs.\n    *   **Types of Generative Models:**\n        *   **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** These models learn a compressed representation of molecules and can then decode this representation to generate new, similar molecules.\n        *   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** These involve two neural networks – a generator that creates molecules and a discriminator that tries to distinguish between real molecules and generated ones. This adversarial process pushes the generator to create increasingly realistic and relevant molecules.\n        *   **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** RL can be used in conjunction with generative models to guide the molecule generation process towards specific desired properties.\n\n3.  **Predicting and Optimizing Properties:**\n    *   As AI models generate candidate molecules, they can simultaneously predict a wide range of properties. This includes:\n        *   **Binding scores:** How strongly the molecule is predicted to bind to the target.\n        *   **Synthesizability:** Whether the molecule is likely to be creatable in a laboratory.\n        *   **Toxicity prediction:** Potential for harmful side effects.\n        *   **Solubility, stability, etc.**\n    *   This predictive capability is crucial because it allows researchers to filter out unpromising candidates early on, saving significant time and resources.\n\n4.  **Iterative Design and Refinement:**\n    *   The AI design process is often iterative. A molecule might be generated, its properties predicted, and then the AI might be prompted to refine it based on those predictions to improve certain characteristics.\n\n**Why is this so important?**\n\n*   **Unlocking New Chemical Space:** AI can explore vast regions of chemical space that might be difficult or impossible for human chemists to explore systematically. This increases the chances of finding truly novel drug candidates.\n*   **Overcoming Resistance:** For diseases where existing drugs face resistance (e.g., antibiotic resistance, cancer resistance), de novo design is essential for creating entirely new mechanisms of action.\n*   **Personalized Medicine:** In the future, AI could potentially design bespoke drugs tailored to an individual's specific genetic makeup or disease profile.\n\n**The Impact:**\n\nCompanies like **Insilico Medicine** and **Exscientia** are pioneers in this space, having successfully brought AI-designed molecules from concept to early-stage clinical trials in record time. This capability signifies a major paradigm shift in how we approach the creation of new medicines, moving from screening and modification to intelligent, in-silico design.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the leading companies at the forefront of **de novo drug design** using AI.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
